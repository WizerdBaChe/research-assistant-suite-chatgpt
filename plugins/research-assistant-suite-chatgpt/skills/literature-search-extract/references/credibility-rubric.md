# Credibility Rubric — source-quality scoring for P3 triage

Companion to SKILL.md P3. Purpose: turn the coarse ordering in P3 into checkable
criteria. Score sources BEFORE extraction effort is spent; a low-credibility source can
still be included, but its tier travels with it into the deliverable's `quality` /
`confidence` fields.

External-service facts below (Retraction Watch access, list statuses) verified by web
search on **2026-07-07**; re-verify on unexpected behavior.

## 1. Venue tier (base score)

| Tier | Venue type | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| A | Established peer-reviewed journal / top conference in the field; established textbook (see §5) | default trust; still run §3–§4 checks for load-bearing claims |
| B | Solid peer-reviewed venue, lower profile; newer OA journal listed in DOAJ | usable; prefer an A-tier corroboration for load-bearing claims |
| C | Preprint (arXiv, bioRxiv…), thesis, technical report, standards-body draft | usable with the §2 published-version check; label as preprint in the source list |
| R | **Reference data compilation** — a curated collection of values drawn from primary literature (§5b) | tier of the value = tier of the PRIMARY source it names; the compilation itself is A-tier as a *pointer* only |
| M | **Manufacturer/vendor datasheet or application note** for a device the vendor makes (§5c) | primary but unreviewed: usable, often the only source, never silently — it carries part number, revision, and stated test conditions |
| D | Non-reviewed web source (blog, vendor whitepaper about someone else's technology, Wikipedia) | never load-bearing on its own; use only as a pointer to A–C sources, or cite explicitly as "secondary web source" when the caller asks about practice/tooling rather than science |
| X | Suspected predatory venue (§4), retracted work (§3) | exclude; if the caller explicitly asked about it, report WITH the flag, never silently include |

Venue tier is about the VENUE's process, not the paper's correctness — a Tier A paper
can still be wrong; conflicts found in P4 outrank venue tier.

## 2. Work-level modifiers

Apply to the base tier:

- **Citation context, not citation count.** Raw counts inflate with field size and age.
  What matters: is the paper cited FOR the claim you're extracting, and are those
  citations supportive, corrective, or refuting? (Semantic Scholar citation contexts /
  "highly influential citations" help here.) A heavily cited-as-refuted paper is a
  negative signal dressed as a positive one.
- **Preprint → published check (mandatory for every Tier C source).** Query Semantic
  Scholar `externalIds` / Crossref for a journal version. If published: cite the
  published version (it may differ from the preprint — note the version you actually
  read). If a preprint has been public for years with no publication and visible
  citations, treat claims as unreplicated until corroborated.
- **Age vs field speed.** For fast-moving topics, a 10-year-old measurement may be
  superseded — check forward citations (search-sources.md) before presenting old
  values as current. For canonical theory, age is fine (often a positive).
- **Independence.** Two papers from the same group/apparatus are ONE line of evidence
  for `confidence` counting, not two.

## 3. Retraction check (mandatory for load-bearing sources)

The Retraction Watch database is free via Crossref (acquired 2023; >63k entries,
updated daily as of verification).

Procedure per DOI: `python verify/citecheck.py <ledger>` runs it on every row (v2,
2026-09-11), or fetch `api.crossref.org/works/<doi>` yourself and inspect the cited
work's **`updated-by[]`** array — each element carries `type` (`retraction`,
`correction`, `expression_of_concern`…), the notice `DOI` and `updated.date-parts`.
**Corrected 2026-09-11:** earlier text here said `update-to`; that field sits on the
NOTICE record and points back at the work, so reading it on the cited work finds nothing
and reports "clean" (verified live on 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0: the work carries
`updated-by` = correction 2004 + retraction 2010). Retraction Watch data is folded into
the same field. No DOI (old book chapters, reports): use the host web search tool for
`"<title>" retraction`
as a best-effort check.

- Retracted → Tier X. If it must be mentioned (caller asked about it, or it's the
  origin of a still-circulating claim), state the retraction with its notice locator.
- Correction/erratum → usable, but extract from the CORRECTED version and note the
  correction in the source list.
- Expression of concern → usable with the concern stated in `confidence`.

Run this check for: every source whose claim is load-bearing in the deliverable, and
every source that a conflict resolution hinges on. Skipping it for background-only
sources at `quick` depth is acceptable — say so in `search_trail`.

### 3b. The check is point-in-time; the corpus is not

A retraction check is true on the day it runs. A source cited in a delivered evidence
table can be retracted the week after, and nothing in this skill would ever notice —
the deliverable is gone, and the accumulated library keeps growing. As of 2026-08-27
that library holds **157 Zotero items, 126 with a DOI** (`zotero_local.py --stats`),
every one of them a source some past deliverable may rest on.

**Standing step — attach it to the Zotero close-out, not to memory.** The close-out
(`connectors.md` §Zotero collection close-out) already runs on every literature wave.
Re-check the accumulated DOIs there, in the same pass:

- **The command (built and calibrated 2026-09-11):**
  `python verify/citecheck.py --retraction-sweep <file>` — takes any file carrying DOIs
  (a ledger, a `.bib`, the project bib JSON, a RIS export), queries Crossref at 1 request
  per second, honours `Retry-After` / `x-rate-limit-*` with one back-off, and prints one
  line per DOI: `ok` / `note` (correction, concern) / `RETRACTED` with the notice DOI /
  `?` (not resolvable here). Exit 1 when anything is retracted.
- Anything that fired: record it against the deliverables that cited that source, and
  tell the user. A retraction discovered late is still worth more than one never found.
  The record IS a reflux event — `python loop/reflux.py retraction --actor a3-retraction-sweep
  --key doi:… --evidence "<Crossref updated-by notice DOI>"` — and `python loop/runs.py affected
  <key>` then names every run, claim and consumer that rests on it (`feedback-loop.md`).

**Its calibration is two-sided and shipped** — `citecheck.py --selftest` carries a
known-retracted DOI that must FAIL (Wakefield 1998, notice 10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60175-4)
and known-good DOIs that must PASS, in both the offline (stub) and live modes; the live
mode additionally probes that Crossref still returns `updated-by` on that work. A sweep
whose selftest is red reports nothing: a clean result from a mis-read field is exactly
what the reader wants to see, which is the one-sided-calibration trap from
`verification-gate.md` in the place it would be believed.

**review-when**: Crossref changes the retraction fields (the live probe in `--selftest`
is the tripwire); a second retraction source (Retraction Watch API direct) is registered.

## 4. Predatory-venue screening

No single authoritative blacklist exists. Beall's List has been unmaintained since
2017 (community mirrors exist — treat as one dated input, never sufficient alone);
Cabells lists are paywalled. Use converging signals:

Positive (whitelist-side) checks, any one is strong:
- Listed in DOAJ (reviewed OA whitelist), Scopus, or Web of Science.
- Publisher is a COPE/OASPA member.
- The venue routinely publishes the field's recognizable groups.

Red flags (≥2 → treat as Tier X pending further evidence):
- Not indexed anywhere above despite years of operation.
- Promised review turnaround of days; prominent APC with no visible review process.
- Editorial board members unverifiable or unaware (spot-check one name).
- Journal title mimics an established journal's title.
- Scope is absurdly broad ("International Journal of Science and Engineering
  Research"-pattern).

When uncertain, keep the source at Tier D handling (pointer, not evidence) and record
the doubt in `confidence` rather than deciding the venue's reputation yourself.

## 5. Textbook credibility & edition judgment

**Canonical-text discovery** ("the standard reference for X"): use the host web search
tool for university
syllabi and qualifying-exam reading lists (2–3 independent programs naming the same
book is a strong signal); check how often papers in the field cite the book for
fundamentals; review articles' introductions usually cite the canonical text. Record
HOW canonicity was established (one line in the source list) — "widely used textbook"
without evidence is an unsupported claim like any other.

**Edition rules:**
- Locate and cite the edition you actually read — page/section locators do not
  transfer across editions (see search-sources.md ISBN resolution).
- Prefer the latest edition for state-of-the-art chapters and pedagogy; an older
  edition is acceptable for unchanged fundamentals, but check the newer edition's
  changelog/preface if the topic might have moved (e.g. a field that had a
  paradigm-relevant result since the old edition).
- If only an old edition is accessible, tag the risk: "3rd ed. (2008); 4th ed. (2019)
  exists but was not accessible — sections on <topic> may be outdated" → `gaps`.
- Beware "international/adapted editions" with shuffled chapter numbers; identify by
  ISBN, not title alone.

## 5b. Reference data compilations (Tier R)

Handbooks and curated databases of measured values — NIST Chemistry WebBook, NIST
Standard Reference Data, the CRC Handbook, Palik's *Handbook of Optical Constants*,
refractiveindex.info and similar. They are neither papers nor textbooks and the first
five tiers do not fit them: their content is *other people's measurements, curated*.

**The rule that follows from that: cite through, do not cite the shelf.**

- When the compilation names the primary source for the value you are taking (most do,
  per entry), **the citation is the primary source**, and the compilation is recorded as
  how you reached it: `(Johnson & Christy 1972, Table I; via refractiveindex.info,
  retrieved 2026-09-03) [full]`. The value's credibility tier is the primary source's.
- When it does **not** name a primary source, the value is `[secondary]` and the
  compilation's own curation is all the warrant there is. Say that explicitly; do not
  let a well-designed database front page substitute for provenance.
- **Conditions travel or the number is worthless** (P4 exactness rule). A compilation
  usually normalises units and sometimes interpolates or re-fits — take temperature,
  wavelength, sample form, and *whether the row is measured or interpolated* from the
  compilation, and say which. An interpolated row is `[synthesis]` by the compiler,
  not a measurement.
- **Edition and revision matter as much as for textbooks** (§5): compilations are
  revised, and a value can change between releases. Record the edition/version and the
  retrieval date (`connectors.md` §Retrieval timestamps — an online compilation is
  exactly the "can change under the citation" case).

**Why this tier is worth having at all:** without it the honest answer to "what is the
literature value of parameter X" collapses to "not found in searched sources" whenever
the value lives in a handbook rather than a paper — which, for material constants, is
most of the time. A gap report that cannot name the right *kind* of source is honest
but useless.

## 5c. Vendor datasheets and application notes (Tier M)

For a device the vendor manufactures, the vendor **is** the primary source: they built
it and they measured it. That makes a datasheet categorically different from the vendor
whitepaper-about-someone-else's-technology that sits in Tier D — and in applied fields
(photonics packaging, power devices, displays) it is frequently the *only* source for a
device parameter. Excluding it produces a false gap; accepting it uncritically imports
a marketing number.

Handling:

- **Identify to the revision.** Part number + document revision + date. A datasheet is a
  living document; "the datasheet says" without a revision is unciteable.
- **Take the test conditions verbatim**, and distinguish **typical** from **guaranteed
  min/max** — this is the characteristic datasheet trap: a typical value has no
  distribution attached and is not a bound. Record which column the number came from.
- **No independent review exists.** Say so in `confidence`. A datasheet number and a
  peer-reviewed measurement of the same quantity are one line of evidence each, not two,
  and if they disagree that is a conflict to report (§P4 rule), not an averaging job.
- **Corroborate when the claim is load-bearing** — a qualification report, a standards
  test method, or an independent measurement. If none is found, that is the finding.
- Datasheets do **not** enter the project's paper bibliography (`connectors.md`
  §Zotero collection close-out) — they are cited in the deliverable and tracked there,
  but a paper bibliography is for papers.

## 6. Bias & coverage-balance check (set-level; run before P5 at standard/exhaustive)

§1–§5 score each source alone; this check looks at the included SET. Any hit goes to
`confidence`/`gaps`; if the affected claim is load-bearing, run ONE targeted
counter-search before synthesis:

- **Citation bubble.** If every source arrived via citation chasing from one seed, the
  set may be a single citing lineage. Test: did at least one included source arrive
  from an independent route (fresh keyword query, different database)? If not, run one
  independent-seed query before claiming consensus.
- **Group/apparatus concentration.** §2 Independence per pair; here per set — if most
  load-bearing values trace to ≤2 research groups, state that in `confidence`.
- **Geographic/language skew.** English-only searching on a topic with strong
  non-English activity (see search-sources.md §Non-English) → record the restriction
  as a `gaps` entry rather than presenting coverage as complete.
- **Positive-result skew.** Published values cluster around successes; null results and
  failed replications are undercited. For contested claims, explicitly search for
  contradicting/replication work (forward chase with "comment", "reply",
  "replication" terms) before reporting one-sided support.

## 7. Scoring worked example (fictional)

> Candidate: "Lee 2021, J. Placeholder Optics" — needed for a load-bearing loss value.
> - Venue: established journal → Tier A.
> - Citations: 40 citations; spot-checked 3 via citation contexts — one is a
>   correction-style comment (Kim 2022) disputing the calibration → modifier: negative.
> - Retraction check: Crossref `updated-by` shows an erratum (2022) revising Table 1
>   values → extract from the erratum, not the original table.
> - Net: include at Tier A with notes; the Kim 2022 dispute goes to `confidence` as a
>   conflict; the extracted value cites "(Lee 2021, Table 1 as corrected by 2022
>   erratum) [full]".
